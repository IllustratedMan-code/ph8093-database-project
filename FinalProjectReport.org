* Introduction

According to Drugbank, there are around 20,000 unique drugs used in
the healthcare system. [cite:@StatisticsDrugBankOnline] To contrast,
the average 20 year old American knows around 40,000 words,
though not necessarily what each
word means.[cite:@brysbaertHowManyWords2016] Therefore, if a physician were to learn all of the drug
names, they would take up around 1/3 of the physician's entire
vocabulary. Having full comprehension of all 20,000 drugs would likely
be extremely difficult, if not impossible. Free and open access tools
typically do not provide interactive visualizations of drug
relationships.[cite:@knoxDrugBank60DrugBank2024; @WebMDBetterInformation; @RxListInternetDrug] 
Instead, they may provide comparison charts or articles. [cite:@DrugsComparisonIndex] 

This project explores the development of an interactive tool meant to
aid physicians in medicine selection and comparison. The tool provides
interactive visualizations meant to make the comparison of medications
easier, showing how different medications relate among their
attributes including: user reviews, composition, side effects, and
usage.

* Methods

** Data source
The data were collected from Kaggle using the search term
"medicine". The collected dataset is entitled "11000 Medicine
details".[cite:@11000MedicineDetails]

After collection of the data, which were contained within a single csv file, the
data were processed into an SQLite database using python and the
pandas package.[cite:@teamPandasdevPandasPandas2025] The database uses the database architecture defined in
[[fig:erdiagram]]. The database is then queried by the visualization tool,
an R shiny app.[cite:@Shiny]

The tool was designed to have two web pages, a "home" page, and a "data
viewer" page. The home page would contain simple statistics and
visualizations for the data set, including the total number of
medicines, while the data viewer page would contain an interactive
browser of the medication, with visualizations that change based on
which medications are selected from a list. The list would be
filterable, and multiple medications could be selected at once. A
simple wireframe mockup is provided in
