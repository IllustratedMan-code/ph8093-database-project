  {"id":"brysbaertHowManyWords2016","abstract":"Based on an analysis of the literature and a large scale crowdsourcing experiment, we estimate that an average 20-year-old native speaker of American English knows 42,000 lemmas and 4,200 non-transparent multiword expressions, derived from 11,100 word families. The numbers range from 27,000 lemmas for the lowest 5% to 52,000 for the highest 5%. Between the ages of 20 and 60, the average person learns 6,000 extra lemmas or about one new lemma every 2 days. The knowledge of the words can be as shallow as knowing that the word exists. In addition, people learn tens of thousands of inflected forms and proper nouns (names), which account for the substantially high numbers of ‘words known’ mentioned in other publications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Brysbaert","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Michaël"},{"family":"Mandera","given":"Paweł"},{"family":"Keuleers","given":"Emmanuel"}],"citation-key":"brysbaertHowManyWords2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01116","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,29]]},"page":"1116","PMCID":"PMC4965448","PMID":"27524974","source":"PubMed Central","title":"How Many Words Do We Know?

  {"id":"knoxDrugBank60DrugBank2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            First released in 2006, DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com) has grown to become the ‘gold standard’ knowledge resource for drug, drug–target and related pharmaceutical information. DrugBank is widely used across many diverse biomedical research and clinical applications, and averages more than 30 million views/year. Since its last update in 2018, we have been actively enhancing the quantity and quality of the drug data in this knowledgebase. In this latest release (DrugBank 6.0), the number of FDA approved drugs has grown from 2646 to 4563 (a 72% increase), the number of investigational drugs has grown from 3394 to 6231 (a 38% increase), the number of drug–drug interactions increased from 365 984 to 1 413 413 (a 300% increase), and the number of drug–food interactions expanded from 1195 to 2475 (a 200% increase). In addition to this notable expansion in database size, we have added thousands of new, colorful, richly annotated pathways depicting drug mechanisms and drug metabolism. Likewise, existing datasets have been significantly improved and expanded, by adding more information on drug indications, drug–drug interactions, drug–food interactions and many other relevant data types for 11 891 drugs. We have also added experimental and predicted MS/MS spectra, 1D/2D-NMR spectra, CCS (collision cross section), RT (retention time) and RI (retention index) data for 9464 of DrugBank's 11 710 small molecule drugs. These and other improvements should make DrugBank 6.0 even more useful to a much wider research audience ranging from medicinal chemists to metabolomics specialists to pharmacologists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Knox","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Klinger","given":"Christen M"},{"family":"Franklin","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Oler","given":"Eponine"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Pon","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Cox","given":"Jordan"},{"family":"Chin","given":"Na Eun (Lucy)"},{"family":"Strawbridge","given":"Seth A"},{"family":"Garcia-Patino","given":"Marysol"},{"family":"Kruger","given":"Ray"},{"family":"Sivakumaran","given":"Aadhavya"},{"family":"Sanford","given":"Selena"},{"family":"Doshi","given":"Rahil"},{"family":"Khetarpal","given":"Nitya"},{"family":"Fatokun","given":"Omolola"},{"family":"Doucet","given":"Daphnee"},{"family":"Zubkowski","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Rayat","given":"Dorsa Yahya"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Hayley"},{"family":"Harford","given":"Karxena"},{"family":"Anjum","given":"Afia"},{"family":"Zakir","given":"Mahi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Siyang"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Liigand","given":"Jaanus"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Harrison"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ruo Qi (Rachel)"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Tue"},{"family":"So","given":"Denise"},{"family":"Sharp","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"da Silva","given":"Rodolfo"},{"family":"Gabriel","given":"Cyrella"},{"family":"Scantlebury","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Jasinski","given":"Marissa"},{"family":"Ackerman","given":"David"},{"family":"Jewison","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Sajed","given":"Tanvir"},{"family":"Gautam","given":"Vasuk"},{"family":"Wishart","given":"David S"}],"citation-key":"knoxDrugBank60DrugBank2024","container-title":"Nucleic Acids Research","DOI":"10.1093/nar/gkad976","ISSN":"0305-1048, 1362-4962","issue":"D1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,5]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","page":"D1265-D1275","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"DrugBank 6.0: the DrugBank Knowledgebase for 2024","title-short":"DrugBank 6.0","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/D1/D1265/7416367","volume":"52"},
